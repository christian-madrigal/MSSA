                    I am a 22 year veteran that just retired from the military.  I am originally from Chicago, Illinois but currently live in California.  I am currently attending the Microsoft Systems and Software Academy where I am learning the skills to become a Software Developer.

                    On my free time I like to spend time with my family and travel to new places we have not been to.  If we are not traveling, we are at the park with our kids or taking our dog for a walk.

                    <br/>Of course on of my biggest hobbies is collecting sneakers. I do tend to collect them and not ever wear them. I think this year I will attempt to wear them to ensure they don't go bad on me.
